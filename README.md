# tutorial_elves_platformer

This is the result of following a [love2d tutorial](http://osmstudios.com/page/love2d-platformer-tutorial-part-1-the-basics). You can move an elf around and jump. This was used as a learning example for myself and children.

Controls
--------

- `up` - jump
- `left` - move left
- `right` - move right

Installation
-------

1. Download and install [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) if you don't already have it.
2. Clone this repo with `git clone git@github.com:3Rs-And-Scott/tutorial_elves_platformer.git`.
3. Run the game `open -n -a love tutorial_elves_platformer
